Meeting 4/1/2025

Divied up roles on what people are going to do and if people are grouped up, when and where theyâ€™re going to meet up to do their assigned work together. 

Agreed on using previous assignment index.js template to assist in creating the foundation of our project.

Also divided up work to allow everyone a change to commit equal amounts of work 3 times each.

Decided to meet up in person during recitation to finish up any loose work that needed to be created.
