    <section class="history">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2023, Bird Dropper began with a simple question: why rely on fuel-consuming vehicles when nature has provided us with the perfect delivery system? Our team of ornithologists and software engineers came together to create a solution that respects our environment while meeting modern delivery needs.</p>
