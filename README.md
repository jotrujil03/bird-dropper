## ⚙️ Prerequisites to Run the App

## 🚀 Instructions on How to Run the App Locally

>
> * First off you'll need to clone the repo:
> ```git clone https://github.com/jotrujil03/bird-dropper.git```
> * Then go to the newly created `bird-dropper` folder, then into the sub-directory `ProjectSourceCode` (or just run the command below):
> ```cd bird-dopper/ProjectSourceCode```
> * Next you'll need to create an `.env` file:
>  ```touch .env```
> * Add these lines to your .env file:
``` POSTGRES_HOST='db'
POSTGRES_DB='users_db'
POSTGRES_USER='postgres'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD='pwd'
SUPABASE_BUCKET=''
SUPABASE_URL=''
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=''
```
> * You'll need to edit one other file. Go to the `/src/init_data` folder and uncomment the `-- \c users_db` line by removing the two dashes in front.
> * Afterwards you should be good to go, so run the command `docker-compose up`, and the rest of the setup should be handled automatically.
